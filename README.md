#Project Description
When I started this class, I was still determining what the course or the layout would be like. I did a coding class in high school, but sadly, I could not recall anything I had learned. But as the lessons started, doing the final project using what we learned proved to help jog my memory. The bio and hero section was the easiest part since it only involved images and paragraph tags for simple text. I combined them to make it more efficent. However, the CSS sheet was new, as in previous experiences, we added style to the HTML. The following section, the hobbies section, was a challenge because coding and styling tables were new to me. Making sure that the style worked and making it responsive proved challenging. But in the end, it was fun. The gallery section was my personal favorite because not only did we have to create our content, but I also loved learning how to add captions and make them respond to different screen sizes. I also like learning to add and style pictures in CSS. The video section was the hardest for me because adding the video was hard because it was a YouTube short. The Iframe tag was a new experience. Learning how to style it was easier but still enjoyable. The blog section was easy to add, but learning to style responsively was challenging. The code would not work, and I had to watch everything repeatedly. The last section, the Contact form, was entirely new, and I loved learning how to create and design it. Seeing it work was excellent, even if I had trouble figuring it out. Overall, this project taught me the importance of good web design and responsiveness and allowed me to push myself in new ways. It was a blast.

#Color Scheme
The color scheme for my website is as follows:
RGB:
    103,163,163 - Breaker Bay
    18,84,84 - Eden
    163,239,240 - Blizzard Blue
    196,240,188 - Tea Green
    255,204,199 - Your Pink
    140,163,135 - Envy
Hex:
    #67A3A3 -Breaker Bay
    #125454 - Eden
    #A3EFF0 - Blizzard Blue
    #C4F0BC - Tea Green
    #FFCCC& - Your Pink
    #8CA387 - Envy
One of the primary reasons for choosing this color scheme was using pink, my favorite color. But I also loved how the other colors complemented each other. My favorite one of these colors was in the photo gallery. I loved how the background color brought out the pink and lit the dotted border. One thing to notice when using the tea green background is that pink was initially used as the text header. But I then changed it to the Eden color because the color choices affected people with accessibility. I love how the colors make some sections pop up and work well together.
