            <h4>All About Me</h4>
                <p> Welcome to my website! I am so glad that you are here today! 
                    I am Abigail DeVries, an artist and designer in Whitehouse Station, 
                    New Jersey. I am a graphic design major specializing in coding and 
                    web design. However, I can also design logos and any branding asset needed. 
                    What I love most about design is getting creative and making original concepts; 
                    it's fantastic! Being a designer is a goal of mind because I get to use my 
                    creative gifts to solve problems, create things, and help people!
                </p>
                <div>
                    <p> Another goal in my heart is to be a small business owner. As I said, 
                        creating things is my passion, and developing unique products is excellent 
                        for using my skills as an artist and designer. It will be much work, but it 
                        sounds fun and is a great way to spread God's word and earn extra money! 
                        I want to start in 2024, planning it and making it a reality!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p> Studying abroad in Paris, France, is another dream as well. I love how pretty 
                        the city looks; the food and culture look attractive, and I always wanted to 
                        explore a different side of the world. Paris is also a trendy place for artists 
                        and designers. Studying design in a place known for its art would be cool. I am 
                        also interested in the French lifestyle and the language!
                    </p>
                
                <div>
                    <p> Some other things that I love are exploring urban towns and cities. I love the 
                        atmosphere, seeing all the stores, the different people, and eating the food. I am 
                        also a big superhero fan - my favorite being Spider-Man. He was the first superhero 
                        introduced to me; my famous ability is his spider sense, which warns him of danger. 
                        I also love watching movies and TV and reading books! Currently, I have been watching 
                        Frasier with Kelsey Grammer.
                    </p>

            <h2>An Excerpt from Sherlock Holmes</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window, 
                and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her presence could be 
                of no help to them in their investigations. Inspector Barton, who had charge 
                of the case, made a very careful examination of the premises, but without 
                finding anything which threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been 
                made in not arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes during 
                which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar, but this fault was 
                soon remedied, and he was seized and searched, without anything being found which 
                could incriminate him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right 
                shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been cut near the nail, 
                and explained that the bleeding came from there, adding that he had been to the 
                window not long before, and that the stains which had been observed there came 
                doubtless from the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr. Neville
                St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a 
                \mystery to him as to the police. As to Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had 
                actually seen her husband at the window, he declared that she must have been either 
                mad or dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the police-station, while the 
                inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford 
                some fresh clue.
                </p>

                <p> And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank 
                    what they had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, 
                    and not Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. 
                    And what do you think they found in the pockets?""I cannot imagine."
                </p>

                <p>No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with pennies 
                and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It was no wonder 
                that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a human body is a 
                different matter. There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house.
                It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat had remained when the stripped
                body had been sucked away into the river.""But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room. Would the body 
                be dressed in a coat alone?"
                </p>

                <p>No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose that this man Boone 
                had thrust Neville St. Clair through the window, there is no human eye which could 
                have seen the deed. What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him 
                that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize the coat, then, and 
                be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and 
                not sink. He has little time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife 
                tried to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his Lascar confederate 
                that the police are hurrying up the street. There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes 
                to some secret hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he stuffs 
                all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat's 
                sinking. He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments had not he 
                heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police 
                appeared." "It certainly sounds feasible."
                </p>

                <p>Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better. Boone, as I have told you,
                was arrested and taken to the station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before 
                been anything against him. He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life 
                appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and 
                the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was doing in the opium den, what 
                happened to him when there, where is he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance
                --are all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot recall any case within my 
                experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."
