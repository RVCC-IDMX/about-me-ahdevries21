            <h4>All About Me</h4>
                <p> Welcome to my website! I am so glad that you are here today! 
                    I am Abigail DeVries, an artist and designer in Whitehouse Station, 
                    New Jersey. I am a graphic design major specializing in coding and 
                    web design. However, I can also design logos and any branding asset needed. 
                    What I love most about design is getting creative and making original concepts; 
                    it's fantastic! Being a designer is a goal of mind because I get to use my 
                    creative gifts to solve problems, create things, and help people!
                </p>
                <div>
                    <p> Another goal in my heart is to be a small business owner. As I said, 
                        creating things is my passion, and developing unique products is excellent 
                        for using my skills as an artist and designer. It will be much work, but it 
                        sounds fun and is a great way to spread God's word and earn extra money! 
                        I want to start in 2024, planning it and making it a reality!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p> Studying abroad in Paris, France, is another dream as well. I love how pretty 
                        the city looks; the food and culture look attractive, and I always wanted to 
                        explore a different side of the world. Paris is also a trendy place for artists 
                        and designers. Studying design in a place known for its art would be cool. I am 
                        also interested in the French lifestyle and the language!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p> Some other things that I love are exploring urban towns and cities. I love the 
                        atmosphere, seeing all the stores, the different people, and eating the food. I am 
                        also a big superhero fan - my favorite being Spider-Man. He was the first superhero 
                        introduced to me; my famous ability is his spider sense, which warns him of danger. 
                        I also love watching movies and TV and reading books! Currently, I have been watching 
                        Frasier with Kelsey Grammer.
                    </p>

                <h2>Background Image Properties</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>The overall look and feel are essential considerations when designing a website, 
                        as they play a part in conveying the message. One way that a designer can achieve 
                        this is through the use of a background image. This CSS allows you to use any 
                        image created or found online as the website's background. Designers can use many 
                        properties to affect your background; the main elements are background-repeat, 
                        background-size, background position, background-origin, and background clip.
                    </p>

                    <p id="background-repeat"><strong>Background Repeat:</strong>
                        Sometimes, one small image will not cut it as the website's background. However, 
                        there is a way to adjust without finding a new image: the background-repeat element. 
                        This CSS element sets how background images repeat. A background image can be repeated 
                        along the horizontal and vertical axes, creating a repeating pattern. The designer 
                        can recount so many times without clipping and can be squished and stretched to fill the 
                        space. If you make a mistake, you can set it back to its initial state and have the image 
                        inherit any elements from the parent element connected to it.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/repeat-01.jpg" alt="background-repeat">
                

                    <p id="background-size"><strong>Background Size</strong> 
                        The background-size element allows the background to be set to a specific size. 
                        A designer can fix this with percentages or pixels to set the length and width 
                        of the image. While you can give two values, placing only one value will put the 
                        other value to auto. You can add a keyword to specify to cover a section, stretching 
                        the image with its full size intact, even if you move the window. The designer can 
                        also contain the background image, which will keep the image at its size even if you
                         move the window. The designer can return the image to its original state and inherit 
                         any elements from the parent element.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/size-02.jpg" alt="background-size">

                    <p id="background-postion"><strong>Background Position</strong> 
                        This property gives the first appearance and position of the image. By using specific values, 
                        you can change the position of the picture. A designer can use keywords to position the image 
                        from its original state by using words like top-left, left, center, and bottom-right, to name 
                        a few. You can also use length values in px to position the elements. The first value moves 
                        the image horizontally, while the second value moves the image vertically. The image can also 
                        be set with percentages, although it differs from length values. The percent values will move 
                        the image to a certain percentage of the webpage. The image can be transferred back to its 
                        original position if there are mistakes and can inherit any element from the parent.
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/position-03.jpg"alt="background-position">

                    <p id="background-origin"><strong>Background Origin</strong>
                        Another vital background property to consider is the background-origin. This property tells the 
                        image where to start as the background, which can range from a whole section to the border of a page. 
                        The original place to start is the padding box, which begins from the left edge of the padding box 
                        and fills the entire section, not going into the border. The designer can also set its origin with the 
                        border box value, starting from the border's top left. The last value, the content box, starts at the 
                        top left and fills the content box, not going into the padding section and the border. The designer can 
                        also return the image to its original state and inherit any elements from the parent. 
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/origin-04.jpg"alt="background-origin">
                    
                    <p id="background-clip"><strong>Background Clip</strong>
                        The last background CSS element is the background clip. Like the previous property, 
                        this element crops the background image to fit in the desired location. The border-box 
                        value is the traditional method for using this element, as it lets the image go all the way 
                        to the edge of the border. The padding box value keeps the image from going out of the padding 
                        and not into the border. The content box value fits the image in the box and extends to the 
                        padding or the border. The background-clip can also inherit any elements from its parent element 
                        and return to its initial state if mistakes happen.
                    </p>
