            <h4>All About Me</h4>
                <p> Welcome to my website! I am so glad that you are here today! 
                    I am Abigail DeVries, an artist and designer in Whitehouse Station, 
                    New Jersey. I am a graphic design major specializing in coding and 
                    web design. However, I can also design logos and any branding asset needed. 
                    What I love most about design is getting creative and making original concepts; 
                    it's fantastic! Being a designer is a goal of mind because I get to use my 
                    creative gifts to solve problems, create things, and help people!
                </p>
                <div>
                    <p> Another goal in my heart is to be a small business owner. As I said, 
                        creating things is my passion, and developing unique products is excellent 
                        for using my skills as an artist and designer. It will be much work, but it 
                        sounds fun and is a great way to spread God's word and earn extra money! 
                        I want to start in 2024, planning it and making it a reality!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p> Studying abroad in Paris, France, is another dream as well. I love how pretty 
                        the city looks; the food and culture look attractive, and I always wanted to 
                        explore a different side of the world. Paris is also a trendy place for artists 
                        and designers. Studying design in a place known for its art would be cool. I am 
                        also interested in the French lifestyle and the language!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p> Some other things that I love are exploring urban towns and cities. I love the 
                        atmosphere, seeing all the stores, the different people, and eating the food. I am 
                        also a big superhero fan - my favorite being Spider-Man. He was the first superhero 
                        introduced to me; my famous ability is his spider sense, which warns him of danger. 
                        I also love watching movies and TV and reading books! Currently, I have been watching 
                        Frasier with Kelsey Grammer.
                    </p>

                <h2>Background Image Properties</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>The overall look and feel are essential considerations when designing a website, 
                        as they play a part in conveying the message. One way that a designer can achieve 
                        this is through the use of a background image. This CSS allows you to use any 
                        image created or found online as the website's background. Designers can use many 
                        properties to affect your background; the main elements are background-repeat, 
                        background-size, background position, background-origin, and background clip.
                    </p>
                    <p id="background-repeat"><strong>Background Repeat:</strong>
                        Sometimes, one small image will not cut it as the website's background. However, 
                        there is a way to adjust without finding a new image: the background-repeat element. 
                        This CSS element sets how background images repeat. A background image can be 
                        repeated along the horizontal and vertical axes, creating a repeating pattern. 
                        The designer can recount so many times without clipping and can be squished and stretched 
                        to fill the space. If you make a mistake, you can set it back to its initial state and 
                        have the image inherit any elements from the parent element connected to it.
                    </p>
